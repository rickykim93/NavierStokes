# NavierStokes
Pre v.1.0.0 Release  - Still in development
This is a Navier Stokes calculator which is used
in computational fluid dynamics.
This is the same formula that ANSYS Fluent uses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* `Numpy`
* `Pandas`
* `Scipy`

### Installing
```python
pip install NavierStokes
```
To upgrade:
```python
pip install NavierStokes -U
```

## Running the tests
Requires `pytest`
```python
python -m unittest tests.TDMAsolver
```

## Documentation
The documentation for:
* [Command Line Functions]()
* [TDMA (Tridiagnal Matrix Algorithm)]()

## Example - See it in Action!
[This page](WIP) uses this module.
